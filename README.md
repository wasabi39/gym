# About the project
Although many rumours exist about the job market for gymnasium teachers in Denmark, little data exists. This project seeks to change that.

An outline of the project:
- I webscraped 7 years worth of job ads from gymnasiejob.dk. (DONE)
- This data was cleaned up, processed and visualized using Python, Seaborn, Pandas and Matplotlib. (DONE)
- A machine learning based analysis of the web scraped data and additional data from the Danish Ministry of Education was conducted using Python, Scikit-learn, Vega and Javascript. This resulted in the development of a model which identified 4 clusters of subjects. (DONE)
- A website presenting the results was developed using Javascript, HTML, CSS, D3.js and Vega (PARTLY DONE, not hosted online yet).
- The development of a generative AI model which is able to generate fictive job ads based off the webscraped data was attempted in Python but the results were not satisfactory due to the low quantity of available job ads (DONE).
